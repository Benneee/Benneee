### Hi there 👋

I'm Benedict, a Front-end Engineer!

Currently ⚒ building with:
- Angular
- Vue.js (including Nuxt.js)

I fiddle around occasionally with:
- Python 🐍 
- Django

I'm a lifelong learner and I enjoy building useful applications, sometimes tiny, sometimes mega ✌️.

Looking to play with some more languages, tools, frameworks and libraries once I get the time 😌.



⚡ Fun fact: 
- TV Series are a valid way to spend my time 🤌.
