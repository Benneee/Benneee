### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Benedict, a Front-end Engineer!

Currently building with:
- Angular
- Vue.js (including Nuxt.js)

I fiddle around occasionally with:
- Python
- Django

Looking to play with some more languages once I get the time.
I'm a lifelong learner who likes to play around with tools and libraries and I enjoy building useful applications, sometimes tiny, sometimes mega.

âš¡ Fun fact: TV Series are a valid way to spend my time.
